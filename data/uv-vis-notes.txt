capacity_data.csv : time (minutes) vs capacity (coulombs). 
Charging occurs first, with 4 total charging half-cycles and 4 total discharging half-cycles. Charging converts AQDS into AHQDQS, its reduced form, and discharging is the opposite reaction. 

dimer_conc_data.csv : time (minutes) vs dimer concentration (molar)
This data was generated from UV-vis spectrophotometry

Total quinone concentration - that is ox form + red form + 2xdimer - should be constant the whole time, so you can use the combination of charge/discharge capacity data and measured dimer concentration to calculate the concentration of each quinone species at each time. 

The granularity is different for each file and the end times of both files varies by a few minutes. Assume both data sets have identical t=0 timepoints.
