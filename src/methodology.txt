A direct calculation from the absorbance data at 570, 620 and 660 nm was performed to obtain the dimer concentration. The state of charge at the beginning of each charge cycle was calculated from this dimer concentration by setting the concentration of reduced AQDS to zero, which is known to be true at the start of the experiment and a good assumption after a discharge cycle given facile AQDS reaction kinetics. By similar reasoning, the SOC was calculated at the end of each charge cycle by setting the oxidized AQDS concentration to zero. The SOC at all intermediate points in each charge cycle was calculated by linear interpolation between these start and end SOCs, interpolating against the number of coulombs moved during the cycle.

The equilibrium constant K_eq was set to 80.0 M^-1 to match the previously published figure. Given a candidate value for the forward rate k_f, we can directly calculate k_r = k_f / K_eq. Then we integrate an ODE to simulate the concentration of each species with terms for Faradaic reactions and the net dimer formation rate. The change in the state of charge is known from the previous step. A broad range of rate constants was considered. The predicted dimer concentration was compared to the experimental data for each proposed rate constant and the root mean square error was calculated. A local minimum was found at k_f = 0.142. This rate was verified to predict a dimer concentration time series that was a close match for the experimental data.
